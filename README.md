Users can:
- create account to start writing posts
- view blog posts without logging in
- comment on blog posts after logging in
- update blog posts
- delete blog posts

What I Learnt:
- Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) using Flask SQLAlchemy database
- Render templates using different routes based on request methods
- Relate multiple databases based on different users
- Authentication and authorization of users using Flask-login
